# CS4105-P2PLANFileSharing

This repository demonstrates work completed as part of the **CS4105 Advanced Communication Networks And Systems** module for Practical 2.

A peer-to-peer file-sharing application has been developed for local area networks (LANs) using IPv4 UDP multicast and TCP. 
Particular attention has been given to the design and implementation of a text-based control-plane protocol, which allows user to discover and 
query file-spaces connected on the network.
The basic requirements for this practical involved the implementation of file-browser discovery, remote browsing, distributed search, and remote file 
download. The additional requirements for this practical involved the implementation of remote file upload and deletion. An analysis of the scalability, 
performance, and privacy/security concerns with the developed file-browsing application is given.
